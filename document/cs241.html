		<h3>Course Goals</h3>
		<p>This is a graduate course on advanced compiler construction.</p>
		<p>Two
          developments are driving the need for new techniques of programming
          language implementation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New hardware architectures (such as RISC and VLIW) require more
            complex optimizations than their predecessors. We discuss essential
            optimization techniques such as redundancy elimination, register
            allocation, and instruction scheduling.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>There is a continual evolution of programming languages 
(Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, Scala, Cilk, OCaml&#8230;) providing novel 
features that need to be implemented efficiently.&nbsp; We examine 
advanced language-implementation topics such as type-directed dispatch, 
garbage collection, and just-in-time code generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These topics will be introduced in class alongside a programming project,
          in which students have the opportunity to apply their new knowledge in
          practice.</p>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>No specific knowledge is assumed for this course. &nbsp;In 
the first week, we will briefly cover all prerequisites that are 
typically taught in an undergraduate compiler course. &nbsp;However, all
 students in this course are expected to be expert programmers in Java, 
C++ or similar languages. &nbsp;If you haven't programmed in Java 
before, you will be expected to learn this quickly on your own during 
the first three weeks of the quarter.</p>
        <h3>Logistics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Class meets Tuesday and Thursday 5pm &#8211; 7.50pm in ICS 180. 
&nbsp;Note that the class session is twice as long as would be 
considered &#8220;normal&#8221; for a 4-unit class. &nbsp;This is because the class 
incorporates a large project for which a lot of material needs to be 
taught up front.&nbsp; Hence, we will have &#8220;double classes&#8221; followed by 
class sessions that won&#8217;t be used but during which you will be expected 
to be implementing.&nbsp; The total number of contact hours will be the 
same as if this had been a regular 4-unit class.</li>
          <li>&#8220;Double&#8221; 3 hour Classes will be given on on January 7th, 
9th, 14th, 16th, 28th, and 30th, February 11th and 13th, and March 4th 
and 6th.</li>
          <li>A <strong>written half-way project report</strong> is due 
on February 11th (the beginning of Week 6).&nbsp; Please state on a 
single page what you have done so far and which of the milestones of the
 compiler project (Step 1 &#8211; Step 5) you have completed.</li>
          <li><strong>Finished projects must be presented in the first three days of Finals Week (March 17-19). </strong>&nbsp;You
 should pace yourself to complete the project by then.&nbsp; If you do 
not finish by this date, you may receive a grading penalty.</li>
          <li><strong>Read your email!</strong>&nbsp; All email sent to your UCI email account will be considered read after 3 working days.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topical Outline</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>everything an undergraduate ever needs to know about compilers (a crash repeat course in the first week)</li>
          <li>intermediate representations, control flow analysis, dataflow analysis</li>
          <li>value numbering and the Static Single Assignment form</li>
          <li>redundancy elimination</li>
          <li>register allocation</li>
          <li>instruction scheduling</li>
          <li>loop optimization and procedure optimization</li>
          <li>loop optimization and procedure optimization</li>
          <li>type-bound dispatch, run-time typing, garbage collection, functional languages</li>
          <li>optimizing object-oriented and parallel constructs (overview)</li>
		  </ul>
		<h3>Grading and Course Requirements</h3>
		<p>In a substantial programming project, students will apply their new
 knowledge by constructing essential parts of an optimizing compiler. 
Students may elect to work in pairs. The class grade will depend on how 
well you do in this project. I will provide several "public" test 
programs as well as a few "secret" ones that you don't get to see until 
you meet with me for the project review.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>You will receive at least an A if your compiler correctly 
compiles all of the public test programs as well as my secret test 
programs.</li>
		  <li>You will receive at least an A- if your compiler correctly compiles all of the public test programs.</li>
		  <li>You will receive at least a B if you can demonstrate that you 
have invested "reasonable effort" into the project, even if your 
compiler doesn't fully run because of a persistent debugging problem. 
The instructor has sole discretion as to what constitutes "reasonable 
effort".</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>There will also be an opportunity to give a short  presentation on a
 paper related to the class.&nbsp; Students who volunteer for this will 
receive extra credit.&nbsp; There won&#8217;t be enough papers to accommodate 
all students, so if you want to do this, volunteer early.		</p>
		<h3>Comprehensive Examination</h3>
        <p>For those students who wish to take a Comprehensive Exam for 
this class, there will be a written examination on  Thursday, Mar 20th, 
4:00-6:00pm in the regular classroom. This is the time slot that the 
Registrar has scheduled for a final exam.</p>
        <p>Note that the grade for the comprehensive exam will be completely separate from your letter grade for this class.</p>

        <h3>Textbook</h3>
		This class does not use a textbook, and buying one of the many 
available textbooks on compiler construction is not likely to help you 
much. Instead,  come to the class well rested and alert and simply 
		try to absorb the material as it is being presented in class.
